A coalition of key players with the right skills and experience to help tackle the climate crisis and its effects, the programme analyses the most pressing challenges across the continent, arming African institutions and policymakers with the vital knowledge on these issues, alongside a range of solutions available to them.  Creating a sustainable future for the continent Dr Fatima Denton, Director of the United Nations University, explains the role of the private sector in delivering holistic sustainable development for Africa in this critical decade, with a focus on the clean energy transition.  This could also see the rise of new industries, which generate investment opportunities and foster innovation across Africa – in turn, leading to the creation of new jobs and opportunities, allowing businesses to employ and nurture local talent, positively contributing to social development.  As these organisations embrace renewable energy and develop new sustainable technologies, the continent has the potential to shift from being a consumer to a producer of global solutions – creating unique opportunities for growth and enhanced competitiveness on the international stage.

Creating a sustainable future for the continent Dr Fatima Denton, Director of the United Nations University, explains the role of the private sector in delivering holistic sustainable development for Africa in this critical decade, with a focus on the clean energy transition.  This could also see the rise of new industries, which generate investment opportunities and foster innovation across Africa – in turn, leading to the creation of new jobs and opportunities, allowing businesses to employ and nurture local talent, positively contributing to social development.  As these organisations embrace renewable energy and develop new sustainable technologies, the continent has the potential to shift from being a consumer to a producer of global solutions – creating unique opportunities for growth and enhanced competitiveness on the international stage.

Creating a sustainable future for the continent Dr Fatima Denton, Director of the United Nations University, explains the role of the private sector in delivering holistic sustainable development for Africa in this critical decade, with a focus on the clean energy transition.  This could also see the rise of new industries, which generate investment opportunities and foster innovation across Africa – in turn, leading to the creation of new jobs and opportunities, allowing businesses to employ and nurture local talent, positively contributing to social development.  As these organisations embrace renewable energy and develop new sustainable technologies, the continent has the potential to shift from being a consumer to a producer of global solutions – creating unique opportunities for growth and enhanced competitiveness on the international stage.

Hi, what are you looking for? Digital Journal Tech & Science Race for AI isn’t zero-sum, says Amazon cloud boss By Published As Google races with Microsoft and OpenAI to create world-changing generative artificial intelligence, some critics see Amazon as lagging behind.  They are in a prime position to capitalize on the new technology — but they have a lot to lose if they don’t cough up the latest innovations. – 25 years of AI – A pioneer of e-commerce, Amazon also dominates the cloud.

There are lots of reasons companies may fail to take advantage of technological innovation, including organizational inertia; a brittle technology stack that makes it hard to adopt newer solutions; or a group of corporate naysayers shutting down even the most well-intentioned initiatives, whether legal, HR, IT or other groups that, for a variety of reasons, including internal politics, continue to just say no to substantive change.  Vineet Jain, CEO at Egnyte, a company that concentrates on storage, governance and security, sees two types of companies: those that have made a significant shift to the cloud already and that will have an easier time when it comes to adopting generative AI, and those that have been slow movers and will likely struggle.  AWS is sick of waiting for your company to move to the cloud He talks to plenty of companies that still have a majority of their tech on-prem and have a long way to go before they start thinking about how AI can help them. It’s a worthy goal, of course, and throughout the main keynote on Day 1 and the Developer Keynote the following day, Google peppered the announcements with a healthy number of demos to illustrate the power of these solutions.

The only exception over the past 50 years in which people actually saved more than they did in the prior cycle was during the economic expansion after the Great Recession, which stretched from 2009 to 2020, the analysis said. That may just be a continuation of a long-term trend: Americans “have consistently saved less in the aftermath of each recession than they did in the prior cycle,” according to an analysis from Wells Fargo economists released Thursday.  The personal saving rate fell to 3.6% in February, the lowest level in more than a year, and in recent years it has hovered below levels seen in the decade before 2022.
